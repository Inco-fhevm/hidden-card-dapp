# Hidden Card Dapp

This Dapp allows the contract to deal a hidden card to the user, and only the user can reveal his/her own card. This demo can serve as a basis for on-chain card games.

The associated contract is [`HiddenCard.sol`](https://github.com/Inco-fhevm/Contracts/blob/main/inco_contract/HiddenCard.sol).

## Get Started

Clone the project, then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dapp should run on http://localhost:5173.
